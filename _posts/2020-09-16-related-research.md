After finding these related research articles, I did a deeper dive of five articles and summurized them below:

= Market Research
My research falls predomintly under the entertainment or technology sector. The entertainment sector had a global value of 2.1 trillion dollars in 2018 according to [https://www.statista.com/statistics/237749/value-of-the-global-entertainment-and-media-market/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237749/value-of-the-global-entertainment-and-media-market/), and the technology sector had a value of 2.9 trillion dollars in 2016 according to [https://www.statista.com/statistics/886397/total-tech-spending-worldwide/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/886397/total-tech-spending-worldwide/). Some of the big players in the industry are Nintendo ($2.2B), Ubisoft ($0.5B), Microsoft ($2.8B), Sony ($3.8B), and Electronic Arts ($1.5B) (These are from Q4 2019 Revenue). Some of these businesses (Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony) generate revenue from more than just game developement, which may partly explain the large discrepancy. There are several older products known for voice commands, such as Nintendogs, Tom Clancy's EndWar, and the VoiceGaming SDK. There appear to be a few newer products as well such as There Came An Echo and The Broken Seal.

= Stakeholders/Audience
Any video game company could potentially benifit, though the main benifit would be to smaller, "indie" game dev companies. As the main benifit would go to these smaller companies, they have to be very aware of costs related to using it. Therefore it makes the most sense to use the free speech-to-text api available at [wit.ai](https://wit.ai) instead of one of the larger products such  as google's speech-to-text. Additionally, they might not have the best of technology available, so whatever I bui;d should work for lower end systems as well.
