# Wit and Maps
Last week, I noticed it seemed that wit.ai was not decteding map squares (ie A4, B6, etc). Therefore I started by seeing if it could be trained to recognize them. After two hours, I've had one success (with A8). Another hour later, I've had only two more successes, both on H8. As I continued to try and train it to recognise this system, I seemed to be slowly building success. However after a total of five hours I decided it is a huge pain to try and get that working though correcting, and have emailed them about it.
