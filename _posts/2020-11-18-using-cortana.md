# Modifying To Use Windows Cortana
Following the advice from last week, I started by setting up a script with compilation directives to limit the Unity Windows Speech commands to Windows builds only. Inside these directives, I set up the DictationRecognizer which turns speech to text, and it has a delegate for calling an assigned function that takes in the text generated by the system (Understanding and setting this up took an hour).
I then had to adjust my troop controller to take a string instead of the wit responses it did before, which took six hours as I had to change basically everything inside it as well as adjust the names of certain objects. This enabled me to see my work for attacks, and decide how to adjust.

# More Attack Work
I spent 30 minutes adjusting the tank attack so that it appears as below. ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/rfLbuTz.gif)

Afterwards I spent 30 minutes adjusting the squad unit's attack to appear as below. ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/aZUbJ5u.gif)
