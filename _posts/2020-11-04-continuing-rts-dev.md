# Camera Controls
The first thing I did this week was set up camera controls. I made it so that by using WASD, the player could move the camera around the map, and cannot move the camera outside the bounds of the map.

# Unit Bubbles
My next step was to add bubbles above the unit that contain that unit's name. As I've Done something similar before, I looked back on that for insperation.

I then began to think on if I should have the backgound of the bubble be the health bar for the unit. However, I am still unsure of this.

# Units, ATTACK!
