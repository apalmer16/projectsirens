Last week waws the Design Expo. During a 4 hour time frame, only one person showed up, so it was a very disapointing experience. My slides from it are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x2x5rFKT8VE5C3yHKrnb-EL7FwnX0MvIld09driE7ww/edit?usp=sharing). Overall, the semester was tough, and am disapointed that the only cloud solution has so many issues. If there was more time I would have looked for ways to interface with Siri. Thanks to those who supported my project, and may the force be with you.
