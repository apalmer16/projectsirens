# Phasmophobia Email Interview
I started the week by emailing a few people for interviews. The team behind Phasmophobia responded fairly quickly, and while they didn't have time for a zoom interview, they did give me some insight into their approach. Phasmophobia was developed in Unity and used the interface with Windows 10 Cortana. They said it was extremely easy to set it up, which I found to be interesting. However it is only usable for games on Windows 10, which limits target platforms. They also said the main issue they were facing at the moment was with permissions, which seems like an interesting issue to be having, but the wit.ai method should avoid most permission issues.
